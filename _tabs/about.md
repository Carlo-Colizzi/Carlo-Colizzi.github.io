<div style="text-align: justify">
I'm Carlo Colizzi, a student and researcher of Computer Science and Cyber Security at the University of Salerno in Italy. I love Computer Science in all its aspects. Right now I'm practicing research at UNISA, in the field of Malware Development, and studying for a Major in Cyber Security.
<br><br>
I think that in Cyber Security the best defence is the knowledge about the attack.
Research on a field like Penetration Testing is crucial to defeat organized crime and to defend IT infrastructres.
